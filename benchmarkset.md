# Instance File Naming Convention

Instances files are named as

    x<X>_y<X>_n<N>_r<R>_s<S>_ps<PS>_pr<PR>_u<U>_o<o>_N<NI>.lp

where

-   `<X>` is the maximum x-dimension
-   `<Y>` is the maximum y-dimension
-   `<N>` is the number of nodes
-   `<R>` is the number of robots
-   `<S>` is the number of shelves
-   `<PS>` is the number of picking stations
-   `<PR>` is the number of products
-   `<U>` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
-   `<O>` is the number of orders
-   `<NI>` is the instance count number

Example

    x10_y10_n100_r5_s20_ps5_pr5_u48_o6_N3.lp

is an instance where

-   `10` is the maximum x-dimension
-   `10` is the maximum y-dimension
-   `100` is the number of nodes
-   `5` is the number of robots
-   `20` is the number of shelves
-   `5` is the number of picking stations
-   `5` is the number of products
-   `48` is the number of product units globally, i.e., total across all products
-   `6` is the number of orders
-   `3` is the instance count number

# Generating Benchmark Sets

The script `./generator/test_instances.py` generates a family of categorized instances
(by repeatedly invoking `./generator/ig.py` with different input parameters). Each
category emphasizes distinct key characteristics typical to the problem. In particular,
the following categories have been provided:

-   `standard_cases`: scenarios based on potential real-life settings
-   `tiny_cases`: extremely tiny toy scenarios
-   `grid_scaling`: scenarios regarding different sizes of the grid
-   `shelves_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of shelves
-   `robots_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of robots
-   `pickingstations_scaling`: scenarios regarding different numbers of picking stations
-   `product_units_orders_scaling`: scenarios regarding combinations of different numbers of product units and orders

For instances, for the category `standard_cases`, a set of 10 instances can be generated by

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST>

where the resulting instances would be save at directory `<DEST>`. Further, one can split
instances into warehouse and order related facts via additional command line option `--split` as follows

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST> --split 5 10

where the first parameter of split specifies the number of warehouses instances (here 5), and the second
parameter the number of order instances (here 10) per each warehouse instance.
A set of the referential instances generated by

    python ./generator/test_instances.py -N 10 -d <DEST> --split 10 10

can be found in the latest [ASPRILO release](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo/releases).
